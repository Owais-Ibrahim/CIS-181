# CIS-181 Web Develop. I/Basic Web
These are files from all the homework and lab assigments from my CIS 181 class taken at City Colleges of Chicago. This course includes activities to learn 
and practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These assigments are not meant to be used to copy code but, instead learn the format and find inspiration from this code.
This was done in accordance to the book with the ISBN: ISBN 9781337814270.
"Bundle: New Perspectives HTML5 and CSS3: Comprehensive, 7th" with Mindtap access written by the author Patrick Carey.
